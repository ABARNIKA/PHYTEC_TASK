## Programs Implemented

### 1) Queue

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.

#### Queue Operations:
- `enqueue()` ‚Äì Add element to the rear of the queue  
- `dequeue()` ‚Äì Remove element from the front  
- `peek()` ‚Äì View the front element without removing  
- `isFull()` ‚Äì Check if the queue is full (for fixed-size array)  
- `isEmpty()` ‚Äì Check if the queue is empty  

---

### 2) Linked List

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each node contains:

- Data (value)  
- Pointer to the next node  

Nodes are stored non-contiguously in memory, forming a chain.

#### Node Structure:
```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
##  Insertion at Beginning (Linked List)

This operation inserts a new node at the **beginning** of a singly linked list.

### ‚úÖ Code:
```c
newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));  // allocate memory for new node  
newNode->data = value;                                // assign data to the new node  
newNode->next = head;                                 // link new node to current head  
head = newNode;                                       // update head to point to new node
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deletion from Beginning (Linked List)

This operation removes the **first node** of a singly linked list.

### üìå Description:
To delete the first node:
1. Store the current head node in a temporary variable
2. Move the `head` pointer to the next node
3. Free the memory occupied by the old head

### ‚úÖ Code:
```c
temp = head;           // store the current head node  
head = head->next;     // move head to the next node  
free(temp);            // free memory of the old head node  
## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Circular Buffer (using Queue)

A **Circular Buffer** (also called a **Ring Buffer**) is a fixed-size buffer that works like a queue, but **wraps around** when it reaches the end. It efficiently utilizes memory and is commonly used in embedded systems, real-time applications, and buffering data streams.

### üîÅ Operations:
- `enqueue()` ‚Äì Add an element to the buffer  
- `dequeue()` ‚Äì Remove an element from the buffer  
- `display()` ‚Äì Show the current contents of the buffer  
- `peek()` ‚Äì View the front element without removing it
## 6Ô∏è‚É£ State Machine (FSM)

This code implements a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** in C that simulates receiving and processing messages byte-by-byte.

It is commonly used in embedded systems and event-driven applications to model logical flows between different system states.

---

### üîÑ States:
- `STATE_WAIT_START` ‚Äì Idle state; waits for the first byte of a message  
- `STATE_RECEIVING` ‚Äì Collects remaining message bytes until `\n` is received  
- `STATE_PROCESSING` ‚Äì Full message is received; triggers logic to process it  
- `STATE_SENDING_RESPONSE` ‚Äì Sends a fixed response (e.g., `"Fine"`) and resets  

---

### ‚ö° Events:
- `EVENT_BYTE_RECEIVED` ‚Äì Triggered when a byte is received in `simulate_input()`  
- `EVENT_NONE` ‚Äì Used internally to move from `PROCESSING ‚Üí SENDING_RESPONSE ‚Üí WAIT_START`
