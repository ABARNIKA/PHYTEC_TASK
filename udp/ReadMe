UDP Chat Application in C

This project implements a UDP-based client-server chat system using C. The client sends and receives messages to/from the server using datagram sockets (UDP).

---

## Files

- `udp_client.c` → UDP Client Source Code  
- `udp_server.c` → UDP Server Source Code  

---

##  How It Works

- The server listens on a specific port and waits for messages from the client.
- The client connects to the server using IP and port, then sends messages.
- The server reads incoming messages and replies back interactively.

---

##  Concepts Used

- Socket Programmingusing `AF_INET` and `SOCK_DGRAM`
- UDP Communication(Connectionless)
- `sendto()` and `recvfrom()` functions
- Infinite communication loop
- Basic error handling and buffer usage

---

##  Compilation

Use the `gcc` compiler to build both server and client programs:


gcc udp_server.c -o udp_server
gcc udp_client.c -o udp_client
 How to Run
 Start the Server

./server <port>
Example:


./server 8085
 Start the Client

./client <server_ip> <server_port>
Example:


./client 127.0.0.1 8085 
In the same project, I want to implement a task where the host PC runs udp_server.c, and the RBA5D2X board acts as the client to communicate with the server, like a chat application. First, I need to modify the client file and cross-compile it for the RBA5D2X board using the appropriate board support files.
