2v0p0
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Added WinUSB support
     The driver mode will change to WinUSB automatically after the update.

     with the "Legacy drivers" option enabled before installing this update.
     If needed, the mode can be changed back to SEGGER using either one of:
     - Simplicity Commander: "commander adapter drivermode" or GUI
     - Admin console: The "sys drivermode" command.
     - SEGGER J-Link Configurator
