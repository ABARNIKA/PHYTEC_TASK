2v0p0
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Added WinUSB support
     The driver mode will change to WinUSB automatically after the update.
     This will cause the USB PID to change, which may cause issues in special setups relying on the PID.
     For Windows 7 and earlier: Please install the latest SEGGER J-Link software pack
     with the "Legacy drivers" option enabled before installing this update.
     If needed, the mode can be changed back to SEGGER using either one of:
     - Simplicity Commander: "commander adapter drivermode" or GUI
     - Admin console: The "sys drivermode" command.
     - SEGGER J-Link Configurator
 * Enabled PCODE and HSS support
 * Updated bootloader to 0.13.0

Addressed issues:
 * Reading CTUNE value could return garbage if no value was set in the radio board

Known Issues/Limitations:
 * VUART on series 2 devices may stop working after a reset of the the target device.


==============================================================
1v6p1
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * None

==============================================================
1v6p0
==============================================================

Added Features:

 * Added command to restore default configuration - "sys restore"
 * Added command to manually disable/enable VCOM - "serial vcom enable/disable"
 * Support controlling power on/off and voltage from PC tools

Addressed issues:
 * Fixed potential for corrupting configuration, including IP config
   * This release will automatically re-enable DHCP if both IP and netmask are configured to 0.0.0.0
 * Identification of radio boards could fail intermittently
 * Fix USB configuration during boot which could trigger an error on Windows
 * Improved PTI baud rate matching at 3.2 MBaud
 * Improved resistance against "garbage" UART bytes when VCOM is disabled
 * Concurrent use of RTT and VCOM could cause data loss on the VCOM channel.
 * Rapid duty cycling around 21 mA could cause NaN samples from AEM.
 * Connecting to port 4901 would fail in certain scenarios. Introduced in 1.5.1.
 * Series 1 device recovery was unreliable. Introduced in 1.5.1.

Known Issues/Limitations:
 * VUART on series 2 devices may stop working after a reset of the the target device.

   * This can be disabled by passing "--nocalibrate" to the "target voltage" command
 * Support clearing the nickname by using syntax 'sys nickname ""'
 * Updated the base J-Link debugger application sources

Addressed issues:
 * None

Known Issues/Limitations:

==============================================================
1v4p12
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Force VCOM enable on for certain Si91x boards lacking HW support

Addressed issues:
 * VUART didn't work on certain xG24 projects
 * For a small set of radio boards, the stored CTUNE values were not exposed to external applications (e.g. Commander/Studio)

Known Issues/Limitations:
 * VUART on EFR32xG22/EFR32xG21 may stop working after a reset of the target device.


==============================================================
1v4p10
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Increased maximum PTI packet length from 1024 B to 1950 B
 * When the reset button is pressed, the board controller refreshes the display
 * Added "sys voltage" CLI command to check VMCU, 5V, Vtarget and 3V3
 * Added "target ledstatus" CLI command to check status of LEDs
 * VUART over PTI is selected automatically on boot for Si91x boards 
 * The reported maximum target interface speed is now dependent on the type of interface (SWD, JTAG, C2)

Addressed issues:
 * Improved PTI capture stability

Known Issues/Limitations:
 * VUART on EFR32xG22/EFR32xG21 may stop working after a reset of the target device.
