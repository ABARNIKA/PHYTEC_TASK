2v0p0
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Added WinUSB support
     The driver mode will change to WinUSB automatically after the update.
     This will cause the USB PID to change, which may cause issues in special setups relying on the PID.
     For Windows 7 and earlier: Please install the latest SEGGER J-Link software pack
     with the "Legacy drivers" option enabled before installing this update.
     If needed, the mode can be changed back to SEGGER using either one of:
     - Simplicity Commander: "commander adapter drivermode" or GUI
     - Admin console: The "sys drivermode" command.
     - SEGGER J-Link Configurator
 * Enabled PCODE and HSS support

Addressed issues:
 * None

Known Issues/Limitations:
 * VUART on series 2 devices may stop working after a reset of the the target device.


==============================================================
1v6p1
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * None

Addressed issues:
 * BRD2204C: VCOM did not work in debug mode OUT. Introduced in 1.6.0.

Known Issues/Limitations:
 * VUART on series 2 devices may stop working after a reset of the the target device.


==============================================================
1v6p0
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Disable VCOM buffers when in debug mode "IN" to allow an external adapter to use the VCOM port
 * Added command to restore default configuration - "sys restore"
 * Added command to manually disable/enable VCOM - "serial vcom enable/disable"
 * Support controlling power on/off and voltage from PC tools

Addressed issues:
 * Fixed potential for corrupting configuration
 * Improved resistance against "garbage" UART bytes when VCOM is disabled
 * Concurrent use of RTT and VCOM could cause data loss on the VCOM channel.
 * Connecting to port 4901 would fail in certain scenarios. Introduced in 1.5.1.
 * Series 1 device recovery was unreliable. Introduced in 1.5.1.

Known Issues/Limitations:
 * VUART on series 2 devices may stop working after a reset of the the target device.


==============================================================
1v5p1
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Automatic configuration of VCOM/PTI over SWO (CoS)
 * Support for displaying logo and configuration on the memory LCD
   * When the reset button is pressed, the board controller refreshes the display
 * The reported maximum target interface speed is now dependent on the type of interface (SWD, JTAG, C2)
 * Support for VCOM config from PC tools
 * Support for reading and writing scratchpad from PC tools
 * Support starting AEM calibration from PC tools
 * Support clearing the nickname by using syntax 'sys nickname ""'
 * Added "sys voltage" CLI command to check VMCU, 5V, Vtarget and 3V3
 * Updated the base J-Link debugger application sources

Addressed issues:
 * None

Known Issues/Limitations:
 * VUART on series 2 devices may stop working after a reset of the the target device.
