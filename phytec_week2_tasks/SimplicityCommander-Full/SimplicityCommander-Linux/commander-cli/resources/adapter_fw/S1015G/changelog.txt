2v0p0
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Added WinUSB support
     The driver mode will change to WinUSB automatically after the update.
     This will cause the USB PID to change, which may cause issues in special setups relying on the PID.
     For Windows 7 and earlier: Please install the latest SEGGER J-Link software pack
     with the "Legacy drivers" option enabled before installing this update.
     If needed, the mode can be changed back to SEGGER using either one of:
     - Simplicity Commander: "commander adapter drivermode" or GUI
     - Admin console: The "sys drivermode" command.
     - SEGGER J-Link Configurator
 * Enabled PCODE and HSS support

Addressed issues:
 * None
