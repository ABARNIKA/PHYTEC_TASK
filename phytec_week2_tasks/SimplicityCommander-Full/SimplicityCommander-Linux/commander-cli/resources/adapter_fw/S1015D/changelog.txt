2v0p0
==============================================================

Added Features:
 * Added WinUSB support
     The driver mode will change to WinUSB automatically after the update.
     This will cause the USB PID to change, which may cause issues in special setups relying on the PID.
     For Windows 7 and earlier: Please install the latest SEGGER J-Link software pack
     with the "Legacy drivers" option enabled before installing this update.
     If needed, the mode can be changed back to SEGGER using either one of:
     - Simplicity Commander: "commander adapter drivermode" or GUI
     - Admin console: The "sys drivermode" command.
     - SEGGER J-Link Configurator

1v4p13
==============================================================
Added features:
 * None

Addressed issues:
 * Board ID did not work on BRD2704A, introduced in 1v4p12.
   Affected boards appear as "BRD0000A", and must be recovered using Simplicity Commander 1.16.1 or newer.

Known Issues/Limitations;
 * VUART on series 2 devices may stop working after a reset of the the target device debug interface


==============================================================
1v4p12
==============================================================
Added features:
 * Added support for new boards, including BRD4003A and BRD1015A
 * Increased maximum PTI packet length from 1024 B to 1950 B
 * The reported maximum target interface speed is now dependent on the type of interface (SWD, JTAG, C2)
 * Added "sys voltage" CLI command to check VMCU and 3V3

Addressed issues:
 * VUART didn't work on certain xG24 projects
 * For a small set of radio boards, the stored CTUNE values were not exposed to external applications (e.g. Commander/Studio)

Known Issues/Limitations;
 * VUART on series 2 devices may stop working after a reset of the the target device debug interface


==============================================================
1v4p9

1v4p8
==============================================================
Added features:
 * Support for configuring PTI baudrate to 3.2 MHz. This requires a RAIL version above 2.8.0.13.
