1v4p8
==============================================================

Added Features;
 * Support for configuring PTI baudrate to 3.2MHz. This requires a RAIL version above 2.8.0.13.
 * Added "serial vcom stats" for statistics on VCOM data.
 * Reduced VCOM latency.
 * Error message on the VUART console if the kit is unable to connect to the target device
 * Improved kit startup time

Addressed Issues;
 * Fixed an issue where the first bytes of a PTI frame could be lost if the frame, including preamble, lasted for more than 10 ms.
 * When using VUART the connection could drop when resetting the target device
 * Ensure that debugger SWD pins are properly deinitialized when not actively debugging. This could cause the target device to draw extra current.
 * Ensure that debugger SWD pins are tristated when in debug mode "off".
 * Support for different number of Up and Down-channels for RTT when using VUART.
 * Fixed a bug where the first PTI-frame after PTI interface reconfiguration was dropped.
 * When using VUART the connection could drop in some situations when the target application was updated

Known Issues/Limitations;
 * BCC Packet handling is currently disabled

 * BCC Packet handling is currently disabled
 * UDP discovery protocol key=value pairs for group "node" not implemented yet
